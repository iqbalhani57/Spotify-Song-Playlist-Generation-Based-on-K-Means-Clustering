# Spotify-Song-Playlist-Making-Base-on-K-Means-Clustering
In this project, I focus on clustering Spotify playlists using the K-Means algorithm. The goal is to group similar playlists based on features such as track popularity, genre, tempo, and other audio characteristics. By applying the K-Means clustering technique, I aim to automatically identify patterns and relationships within a diverse set of playlists, making it easier to analyze and understand musical preferences. This process is especially useful for categorizing playlists for new upcoming songs, ensuring they are placed in the right context and reach the right audience.

Throughout this project, I will preprocess audio data, apply K-Means clustering, and visualize the results to uncover meaningful patterns in playlists.
